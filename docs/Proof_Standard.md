# Proof Standard (Stub)
This markdown is a placeholder for Proof_Standard.pdf so links in role logs do not 404.
- Visual proof: public Figma or PNG/PDF.
- Data proof: public Google Sheet or repo CSV.
- Execution proof: public deploy URL and/or GitHub repo/recording.

(Replace this file later with the real PDF or keep both.)
